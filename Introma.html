    <!--Background to Martial Arts-->
    <h2> Background to Martial Arts</h2>
      <p class = "r"> Rookie Road (2023a) defines Martial arts as different combat styles used for self-defence. In 1500 BC, archaeological and historical indicate that martial art started as long as humans existed because people throughout history wanted to participate in fighting for protection. According to NY Martial Arts Academy, Asia is considered as the birthplace for martial arts; infact, in china martial arts were used for hunting and protection from attackers(Achenhuang, 2018). Hashashin (2015) explains that martial arts are linked to religious and spiritual beliefs; indeed, Ancient India's martial arts is related to spiritual beliefs; for example, the martial art Kalaripayattu which focuses on flexibility and agility(Great Britain Top Team, 2021). Britannia clarifies that martial arts is divided into two categories armed and unarmed; for example, swordsmanship is armed while hand to hand combat is unarmed. </p>
